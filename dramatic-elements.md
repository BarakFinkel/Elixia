# Dramatic Elements of *Elixia*

### **Challenge**
The game is designed to be challenging but fair, inspired by *Souls-like* games. Combat encourages players to learn, adapt, and improve their skills. Instead of traditional difficulty levels, progression is tied to mastering mechanics and understanding enemy behaviors.

Key elements:
- **No difficulty modes**: Avoiding the common "more health/more damage" adjustments, which can feel tedious. The challenge lies in mastering mechanics.
- **Progressive difficulty**: Enemies become harder and may require exploiting specific weaknesses or using strategic combinations of alchemical tools.
- **Dynamic encounters**: Combining previously encountered enemies creates layered challenges that test the player’s adaptability.
- **Fair design**: The game ensures that while difficult, every challenge feels surmountable through persistence and learning.

The philosophy draws from *Souls-like* games, aiming to provide players with the rewarding feeling of overcoming challenges.

### **Flow**
To maintain engagement:
- The game provides meaningful rewards for progress, avoiding the frustration of receiving useless items after tough challenges.
- A robust RPG system ensures progression feels tangible. As players gain skills, their characters’ stats and abilities also evolve, reflecting growth in both skill and strength.
- Challenging encounters and bosses create "just one more try" moments, keeping players invested.

### **Amusement**
While the main objective is clear, the game supports exploration and discovery:
- Hidden items, secret bosses, and locations encourage players to stray from the main path.
- Appeals to players who love challenges, exploration, and collection mechanics.

The game prioritizes depth and originality, catering to a niche audience that values difficulty and discovery over accessibility to a wider demographic.

The primary emotional goals include:
- **Satisfaction**: Players feel rewarded when completing difficult challenges, defeating tough bosses, or uncovering rare secrets.
- **Sadness**: The desolate and dark world creates moments of melancholy, especially when learning about the protagonist's tragic backstory or encountering remnants of a lost world.
- **Happiness**: Achieving progress, uncovering secrets, or mastering combat mechanics provide a sense of joy and accomplishment.
- **Tension and Fear**: Facing unknown, dangerous enemies in eerie environments keeps players on edge.

### **Background**
The alchemist awakens in a ruined sanctuary with no memory of their past. They discover they are cursed, and the world is overrun by corrupted creatures. As they venture deeper, they learn that their student betrayed them, using their shared alchemical discoveries to unleash monsters.

The student seeks a legendary alchemical artifact capable of controlling human minds, believing it will grant ultimate power. The alchemist must recover their memory, stop their former student, and undo the devastation caused by the betrayal.

#### **Storytelling Method**
- **NPC Dialogs**: Friendly or neutral characters provide pieces of the story through conversations.
- **Hidden Notes**: Scattered throughout the world, these provide insights into the past and the antagonist’s motivations.
- **Item Descriptions**: Certain items reveal fragments of the lore, often requiring players to piece together the narrative themselves.
