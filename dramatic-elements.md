# Dramatic Elements of *Elixia*

### **Challenge**
The game is designed to be challenging but fair, inspired by *Souls-like* games. Combat encourages players to learn, adapt, and improve their skills. Instead of traditional difficulty levels, progression is tied to mastering mechanics and understanding enemy behaviors.

Key elements:
- **No difficulty modes**: Avoiding the common "more health/more damage" adjustments, which can feel tedious. The challenge lies in mastering mechanics.
- **Progressive difficulty**: Enemies become harder and may require exploiting specific weaknesses or using strategic combinations of alchemical tools.
- **Dynamic encounters**: Combining previously encountered enemies creates layered challenges that test the player’s adaptability.
- **Fair design**: The game ensures that while difficult, every challenge feels surmountable through persistence and learning.

The philosophy draws from *Souls-like* games, aiming to provide players with the rewarding feeling of overcoming challenges.

### **Flow**
To maintain engagement:
- The game provides meaningful rewards for progress, avoiding the frustration of receiving useless items after tough challenges.
- A robust RPG system ensures progression feels tangible. As players gain skills, their characters’ stats and abilities also evolve, reflecting growth in both skill and strength.
- Challenging encounters and bosses create "just one more try" moments, keeping players invested.

### **Amusement**
While the main objective is clear, the game supports exploration and discovery:
- Hidden items, secret bosses, and locations encourage players to stray from the main path.
- Appeals to players who love challenges, exploration, and collection mechanics.

The game prioritizes depth and originality, catering to a niche audience that values difficulty and discovery over accessibility to a wider demographic.
